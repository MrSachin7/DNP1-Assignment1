# DNP1-Assignment1
DNP1 first assignment by me
Minimum requirement
This assignment is open-ended, meaning that the minimum requirements are few, but there is plenty of room to expand upon the assignment, if you wish to challenge yourself. See optional suggestions in the next section.

As a minimum, you must be able to:
1.	Register, log in, and out
2.	Create a new post (when logged in), containing a title and a body (create a new page for this)
3.	View all posts, i.e., just a header (either use the front page or create a new page)
4.	Click on a post in the post overview, to go to a new page, where you can view the entire post.
