The developers need to specify now, with a very cheeky \u0022?\u0022 sign to let the compiler know the variable is nullable. According to the .NET devs , null-pointer exception was the last year\u0027s biggest nightmare as reports suggests it was 49.253% of time the main reason over 27.36% of company crashing over. However, the reaction from the community is mixed. Most old devs are criticizing this saying , its not because of the exception but due to the new noob devs while majority of new programmers adore the concept.",
